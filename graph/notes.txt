                     Graph Algorithms
1. Overview 
   A graph is an abstract representation of a set of peer entities with possible homogeneous relationships 
   any two invidual entities.  
 
   There are many operations on topology common to graphs of all kinds, such as traversing all vertices,
   finding a tree subgraph spanning all composing vertices with certain special properties, finding a path
   linking two non-adjacent vertices satisfying certain constraints, and so forth. 

   Generally, the way adjacency is reprsetned significantly affects the time complexity in carrying 
   out those   operations. It is indisputable that the linked adajacency list is more efficient than a 
   corresponding matrix representation.

   In this exercise, BFS, DFS,Kruskal and Prim algorithms are implemented. 

   Both Kruskal and Prim fall into the category of greedy algorithsm, the two differ in a few aspects.
   Kruskal does not require adjacency scanning on a vertex, it simmply collects all the edge/link 
   information, and run a global sorting once, this approach makes it little use for graphs with varying 
   weights or changing link status. Also notable that, in execution, every time an edge is selected, there 
   is no gurantee that edges already selected form a tree structure.   

   Prim follows a breadth first approach, each time an edge selected, all selected edges form a minimal
   spanning for the ever-growing subgraph which has been explored. The computing of MST can be localized and
    distributed, this makes Prim widely used in network switch applications. 
   
   Prim algoriths by itself can only find one minimal spanning tree; multiple passes are demanded to obtain
   minimal spanning tree forests in the graph if the graph is composed of several undisconnected subgraphs.
